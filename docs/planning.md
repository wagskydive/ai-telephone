# AI Telephone System â€“ Development Planning & Roadmap

## Overview
This planning document defines the phases and milestones to guide development of the AI-powered telephone system using analog phones, Asterisk, Raspberry Pi, and AI personality backends.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Goal:** Establish working Asterisk system and analog phone routing.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite
- [ ] Install Asterisk
- [ ] Configure ATA (2-port)
- [ ] Connect analog phones via mini PBX
- [ ] Confirm trunk dial-out works from Pi

---

## Phase 2: Voice Interface Layer
**Goal:** Create basic AI loop using VAD, Whisper, LLM, and TTS

### Tasks:
- [x] `call_handler.py`: core handler script
- [x] `vad_recorder.py`: record speech naturally
- [x] `audio_player.py`: play WAV responses
- [x] Add Whisper + TTS (local or remote)
- [x] Create `/process-audio` endpoint (Flask or FastAPI)
- [x] Test basic call â†’ AI â†’ response cycle

---

## Phase 3: Character System
**Goal:** Implement skydiving personalities with extensions and memory

### Tasks:
- [x] Define character schema (`personalities.json`)
- [x] Add unique extensions (701â€“705)
- [x] Add random personality logic for ext 1000
- [x] Print-ready character card generation
- [x] Add initiative-based outbound call loop
- [x] Integrate `memory_logger.py`
- [x] Save memory log per character

---

## Phase 4: Situation Engine
**Goal:** Add LLM-generated call context and realism

### Tasks:
- [x] Design prompt format
- [x] Implement `situation_generator.py`
- [x] Add call-start context logic to `call_handler.py`
- [x] Use LLM to inject greeting mood/situation

---

## Phase 5: Backend API Server
**Goal:** Run all LLM interactions on local Ollama server

### Tasks:
- [x] Flask app with:
  - `/process-audio` â€“ main AI loop
- [x] Add Whisper + LLM pipeline
- [x] Add TTS return, give multiple options for TTS to user through gui, include Elevenlabs
- [x] Secure endpoint for Pi use

---

## Phase 6: Deployment & Polish
**Goal:** Package and test final experience

### Tasks:
- [x] Install all services via `install.sh`
- [x] Add systemd service for startup
- [ ] Optimize TTS playback latency
 - [x] Final memory review logic (summarization tuning)
- [ ] Final test: character recognition by AI
