# Character Card Generation

Use the helper in `src.card_generator.generate_cards` to create printable text files for each personality:

```bash
python -m src.card_generator path/to/personalities.json output_dir
```

Each card contains the character name, extension and tagline. These can be styled or printed as needed.
