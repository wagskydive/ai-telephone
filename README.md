# AI Telephone

AI Telephone connects vintage analog phones to AI personalities via a Raspberry Pi running Asterisk. When a caller picks up the handset or receives a call, they converse with humorous skydiving characters powered by a local or remote language model.

## Features
- Natural voice conversations using VAD recording and TTS playback
- Skydiving-themed personalities with memory logs
- Random or extension-based character selection
- Situation-aware prompts generated by the LLM
- Flask backend API with Whisper STT and multiple TTS engines

## Installation
For a clean Raspberry Pi, download the `bootstrap.sh` script which clones this repository and runs `install.sh`:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/wagskydive/ai-telephone/raw/main/bootstrap.sh -o bootstrap.sh
sudo bash bootstrap.sh
```

`install.sh` creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and registers the `ai-telephone.service` systemd unit.

## Usage
The service starts automatically on boot. You can also run the API server manually:

```bash
python -m src.api_server
```

Pick up a connected analog phone and dial 701â€“705 to reach a specific character or 1000 for a random one.

## Development
Create a virtual environment and install requirements:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the automated tests with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest -q
```

See the `docs/` directory for design notes, deployment instructions and the user manual.
